This is an web-based serious game that can be used in hand rehabilitation to assess gross manual dexterity and fine motor skills.

The application needs to be uploaded on a web hosting server under a specific domain name. The domain name must be added in the PHP files wherever needed. Also there is the need of a relational database, that has to be created and its credentials must be added wherever needed in the given files.

The application can also run without the use of a hosting server, lacking the capability of saving scores. To do that all php code must be removed, all php files should be either renamed or deleted and simple modifications must happen to some of the files.
